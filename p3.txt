Painting and CS are alike
CS is an extremely broad descriptor
Programmers get mixed up in research
Difficult to judge programmer design
Arguable how much a programmer needs to know about CS theory.
People program differently, some programmers are more like artists and writers than mathematicians.
Big companies want people to implement their design. They want safe design. The best way to explore is in uncharted waters (startup).
But startups are kinda nasty.
Open source on the side.
Learn to program by programming and looking at other good programs.
Program specifications will adjust
Think of the audience and capitalize on it.
